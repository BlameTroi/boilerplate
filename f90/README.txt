i had a setup for Modern Fortran that was working well enough but
since then the Fortran folk have come out with an excellent Fortran
Package Manager (fpm). i was also using GNU Make and the Fortran folk
lean toward CMake.

i've since moved to CMake myself but deleted the only boiler plate
here. if i do another Fortran project i'll update this with what i
find works.

for things fortran, check out the Fortran Language Organization
generally on the web and on github, along with the Fortran Language
Discourse. high quality low latency help from people who know whereof
they speak.
